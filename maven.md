TODO: why use maven? and how to use it both on command line and in eclipse?

`maven` downloads libraries, so you don't have to download a java library with a web browser,\
put it into some folder and set the `classpath` for compiling.\
(The `classpath` is the path where additional classes for you java application are located.\
The classpath should only be necessary if the classes are not in the same folder.)
