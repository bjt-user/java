Gradle is build tool for java like Maven and Ant.

According to wikipedia.org Gradle was released 2007 while Maven was release 2002 and Ant was released in 2000.

#### Installation

#### Fails

I tried creating a `Gradle Project` with `Eclipse` but it failed.\

Three hidden directories were created, but no folder structure for source and class files.\
Also no `gradle.build` file.
