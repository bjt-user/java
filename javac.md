Executing java programs with `java filename` is slow.

You can compile the `.java` file to a `.class` file like this:
```
javac helloworld.java
```

Now there is a `helloworld.class` file in your folder.

You can execute that file by typing:
```
java helloworld
```
Hint: **Don't** type the `.class` extension as it will create an error.
